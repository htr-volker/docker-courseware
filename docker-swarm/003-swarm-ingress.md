# Swarm Ingress

- Overview
    - As containers in a swarm are created and run across multiple nodes in a Swarm, there needs to be a way for network traffic to be balanced across containers and nodes
    - This module discusses how Docker Swarm uses a routing mesh to balance and redirect its incoming traffic (ingress) across containers within a cluster
    - It also illustrates how to use a load balancer to balance traffic across multiple nodes, making use of each of their address space
- Network Mesh
    - When a service is created, its containers are distributed evenly across nodes in a cluster
    - If a container within one service needs to communicate with another in order to function (such as a frontend service making an API call to a backend service), it is highly likely that the other container will be on another node
    - Similarly, if there are many replicas of a web application's frontend application within a Swarm, incoming networking traffic should be making use of all of these replicas, regardless of which machine the request is being routed to
    - Swarm's *network mesh* or *routing mesh* creates a network that connects all containers in a Swarm across nodes and balances ingress traffic across each of them
    - Within each node is a load balancer, which can balance traffic across any container within the cluster - this means that you could make an HTTP request to a worker node and have your request redirected to a container on the manager node, and vice versa, or another worker node!
- Load Balancing Across Nodes
    - Swarm balances traffic across containers within the cluster, but can't balance requests across each node's network namespace
    - To achieve this, we need a separate load balancer
    - NGINX is a popular web server tool with multiple functionalities, including as a reverse proxy and as a load balancer
    - Its functionality can be configured through editing its `nginx.conf` file
    - Below is a configuration for load balancing across two nodes in a Swarm for a basic web server
        - Show the code block
    - Let's break it down
        - upstream
            - This section handles the load balancing
            - We are effectively grouping together the nodes in our swarm - we specify the private IP addresses
            - We can then refer to any of these IP addresses using the name of the upstream
        - server
            - Here we are specifying a proxy pass that will redirect incoming traffic at a particular location to the upstream (group of IP addresses)
    - Benefits of our external load balancer
        - Makes use of each of our nodes' network namespaces while the user only has to utilise one, so no one machine is having to process incoming requests
        - Allows us to keep our cluster entirely disconnected from the internet, making the Swarm much more secure

    - Rework the exercise into a tutorial
- Exercise
    - Get the following into a Swarm cluster with an NGINX load balancer
        - 1 Manager and 1 Worker running the Duo Task servives, 2 replicas for each service
        - 2 Managers and 2 Workers running the Trio Task in services, 5 replicas for each service and a volume to persist the database contents
